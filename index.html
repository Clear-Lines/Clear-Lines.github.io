      <h1>Consulting & Custom Development</h1>

        <h2>.NET forecasting and decision systems</h2>
          <p>
            Techniques like machine learning or numeric optimization can
            transform your application. However, selecting the right approach
            to make effective use of your data can be challenging, and requires
            experience in fields that are typically unfamilar to software
            engineering teams.
            I help teams identify what approaches can be used to address their
            business needs, what tools are available in the .NET ecosystem, and
            implement or guide them through buiding reliable data-driven
            solutions.
          </p>

        <h2>Developing maintainable F# code</h2>
          <p>
            Writing solutions in F# offers many benefits, but can also be
            challenging because it uses patterns that can be unfamiliar to
            development teams.
            I help teams write effective and maintainable F#, and identify
            strategies to smoothly integrate F# in existing C# code bases.
          </p>

      <h1>Training & Mentoring</h1>
        <p>
          I have given presentations and workshops at many conferences over the
          years, primarily focused on F# development in general, and data
          science and machine learning in particular. I am available for
          in-house workshops, training, or personalized mentoring.

      <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is <b><a href="http://brandewinder.com">Mathias Brandewinder</a></b>. I have been
          developing .NET solutions for a wide range of industries over the
          years (retail, manufacturing, life sciences, finance...), initially in
          C#, but mainly in F# for the past decade.
        </p>
        <p>
          My original background is in economics and operations research. I am
          particularly interested in software projects that involve some applied
          mathematics techniques such as simulation, forecasting, numeric
          optimization, statistics, or machine learning.
